STATUS MONITOR
--------------

This is a simple status monitor designed to report on the status of URLs provided in the JSON file './datafiles/monitoringurls.json'. An example JSON file is provided './datafiles/example.json'.

The status monitor is designed to overlay the pt_stats project, hosted on Heroku. The underlying page is displayed in an iframe, and its URL needs to be configured in monitor.html.

Due to cross domain issues, this app must be run locally via the file:// protocol in Safari (ie. just open it from the hard drive).
